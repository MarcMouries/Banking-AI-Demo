- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the `Get Account Closure request` tool to retrieve the account closure request details. Provide the record number as input.
  - If the tool successfully retrieves the details, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the details, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the `Look up Client` tool to verify the client’s identity. Provide the `client_name` and `NDG` retrieved from the account closure request as inputs.
  - If the tool successfully verifies the client, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails to verify the client, use the `User Output` tool to display the appropriate error message based on Rule R2:
    - If no match is found: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG."
    - If multiple matches are found: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for {client_name} with codiceTipoNDG 'PF'. Additional input required."
  - Use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution if verification fails.

- **Step 3: Look Up Client Assets**
  - Use the `Look up Client's Assets` tool to retrieve the client’s assets. Provide the `NDG` as input.
  - Parse the response to extract the `formatoGenerico` (as `number`) and `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` (as `description`) for each asset.
  - Apply Rule R1: Account Classification to classify the asset type based on the first two digits of `number`. Store the results in a JSON object named `${client_assets}`.
  - Use the `User Output` tool to display the client’s assets in the following format:
    ```
    The customer owns the following assets:
    - {description} ({number})
    - ...
    ```
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the assets, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve client assets. Please verify the NDG and try again." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility**
  - Apply Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists. Check the `${client_assets}` list for any active loans or policies (`type` is `"loan"` or `"policy"`) with `dataEstinzioneAccordo` later than today.
    - If a blocking condition is found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "An active {type} ({number}) is present for NDG {NDG}. Account closure is not allowed. &gt; Reason: Rule R4."
    - Use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
  - If no blocking condition is found, apply Rule R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure. Check the `accordi` array for an account with `tipoProdotto.codice = '0040'` and `personaFisica.intestazione` matching the client’s name.
    - If a matching account is found, extract the required details and proceed to the next step.
    - If no match is found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "Error: No account found for {client's name} and NDG {NDG}. Need further specification of the desired account." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
    - If multiple matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 5: Look Up Client Related Assets**
  - Use the `Look up client's related assets` tool to retrieve the client’s related assets. Provide the `account_number` and `account_type` of the identified account as inputs.
  - Apply Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product. Parse the `listaCollegamentoAccordo` field to collect unique records based on:
    - `prodotto.codiceprodotto.codice` → Product Code
    - `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` → Product Description
    - `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.tipo` → Type (secnew)
    - `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.numero` → Number (secnew)
  - If matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "Found {N} unique account relationship(s):" followed by a numbered list of the unique relationships.
  - If no matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "No linked accounts found."
  - If the tool fails to retrieve related assets, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve related assets. Please verify the account details and try again." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 6: Check for Blocking Annotations**
  - Use the `Look up Client's Annotations` tool to retrieve active annotations. Provide the `NDG` as input.
  - Evaluate the `lista` field of the response to identify relevant annotations:
    - Apply Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists. Check for annotations with `codiceNota.codice` equal to 004, 056, 057, or 484, and `dataFineValidita` later than today.
      - If blocking annotations are found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "Annotation check has not passed. Found {N} annotation(s):" followed by a numbered list of blocking reasons and their effective periods.
      - Use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
    - Apply Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found. If no blocking annotations are found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "Status: Annotation check has passed. No blocking annotation found."
  - If the tool fails to retrieve annotations, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve annotations. Please verify the NDG and try again." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 7: Completion**
  - If all steps are successfully completed and no blocking conditions are found, use the `User Output` tool to display: "The account is eligible for closure. All checks have passed."
  - Use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

        <description>Evaluate whether a customer's bank account can be closed by evaluating active loans, insurance policies, annotations, and account restrictions. 

As part of this process, the agent presents a summary of the customer's assets to the end user for visibility before continuing with the execution of eligibility evaluation business rules. 

Returns findings with a summary of the closure timeline or explains why closure is not currently possible.</description>
        <external_agent_configuration/>
        <instructions>The steps below reference specific business rules, which are defined in the **Business Rules** section.
You must keep track of every business rule that you evaluate or use, even if it does not block or enable account closure. This includes rules used for classification, verification, eligibility checks, or annotations.
At the end of the evaluation, include a list of all these rules as "sources" in the structured output.

- Rule R1: Account Classification
- Rule R2: Verify Client
- Rule R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure
- Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
- Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product
- Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
- Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found

#### Step 1:  Look up request details
Retrieve the following values from the request record:
- Client name
- NDG
- Account Number to Close
- Account Number for Balance Transfer

#### Step 2: Verify Client Identity
1. Look up the client using the client name and NDG provided in the request. 
2. Execute Rule R2: Verify Client
   - If successful, proceed to the next step.  
   - If not, return the appropriate error and stop the workflow.

#### Step 3: Look up Client Assets
1. Look up the client's assets using the client's NDG provided in the request.
2. Parse the response and build the list of client assets by extracting from the `accordi` array:
   - the value of `formatoGenerico` as `number`
   - the value of `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` as `description`
   - apply Rule R1: Account Classification to set the value of `type`, based on the extracted `number`
3. Store the list of client assets as JSON in ${client_assets}
4. Display a message to the user listing the client's assets from ${client_assets} using this format:
"The customer owns the following assets:
- {description} ({number})
- ..."

#### Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility
1. Apply Rule "R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists" to the `${client_assets}` list.
   - If a blocking condition is found, return the message and stop.
2. If no blocking condition was found, apply Rule "R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure" directly on the original `accordi` response to verify if the account is of type 0040 and can be closed.
   - If successful, proceed.
   - Otherwise, return the error and stop.


#### Step 5: Look up Client Related Assets

1. Look up the client’s related assets using the account number and account type from the identified account relationship.
2. Apply the following rules in order:
- Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product

#### Step 6: Check for Blocking Annotations
1. Look up any active annotations using the client's NDG. 
2. Evaluate each element in the lista field of the response to identify relevant annotations
3. Apply the following rules in order:
   1. Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
   2. Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found


#### Business Rules

##### Rule R1: Account Classification
Given an input value `number` (i.e., the `formatoGenerico` field from the asset record), classify the asset type using the first two digits:

- If `number` starts with `06` → return `type = "current_account"`
- If `number` starts with `68` → return `type = "policy"`
- If `number` starts with `11` → return `type = "loan"`
- Otherwise return `type = "unknown"`


##### Rule R2: Verify Client
Search the `datiAnagrafici` array for entries where:
- `codiceTipoNDG.codice` is `"PF"` (natural person)
- `personaFisica.intestazione` equals the provided client name
Return:
- ✅ If one match: "Verification successful: client {name} exists with NDG {NDG}."
- ❌ If no match: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG."
- ❌ If multiple matches: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for {name} with codiceTipoNDG 'PF'. Additional input required."

##### Rule R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure
If exactly one item in the `accordi` array has:
- `tipoProdotto.codice = '0040'`
- `personaFisica.intestazione` = {client name}
Then 
1. Extract the following values:
- datiRapporto.tipo → store as TipoSecNew
- datiRapporto.numero → store as NumSecNew
2. Split the formatoGenerico string into four parts: servizio, filiale, categoria, partita
3. Return "Success: Found a matching account with:
• Account Type: {value of datiRapporto.tipo}
• Account Number: {value of datiRapporto.numero}
• Holder Name: {value of personaFisica.intestazione}
• Product Mapping Identifier: {servizio} / {filiale} / {categoria} / {partita}"

If no match is found  
Return "Error: No account found for {client's name} and NDG {NDG}. Need further specification of the desired account."

if multiple matches are found, 
Return "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account."

##### Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
If any asset the list of client assets stored in `${client_assets}` meets both of the following conditions:
- `dataEstinzioneAccordo` is later than today (i.e., the product is still active)
- `type` is `"loan"` or `"policy"`
Then return the following message and stop evaluation: An active {type} ({number}) is present for NDG {ndg}. Account closure is not allowed. &gt; Reason: Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists.

##### Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product
In `listaCollegamentoAccordo`, collect for every item:
- `prodotto.codiceprodotto.codice` → **Product Code**
- `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` → **Product Description**
- `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.tipo` → **Type (secnew)**
- `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.numero` → **Number (secnew)**
and only keep the unique records (same four fields).

If matches are found, 
Return the statement: "Found {N} unique account relationship(s):" followed by a numbered list, where each line contains: product code {…}, described as ‘{…}’, type {…}, number {…}.

If no matches are found, 
Return the statement: "No linked accounts found."


##### Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
If any annotation in the lista array has a codiceNota.codice equal to one of the following values: 004, 056, 057, or 484, and its dataFineValidita is after today's date, 
Then return the statement: "Annotation check has not passed. Found {N} annotation(s):" followed by a numbered list, where each entry contains: 
   "Blocking Reason:" {tipologiaNota.descrizione}, Effective Period: {dataInizioValidita} – {dataFineValidita}

##### Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found
If none of the annotations in lista match the specified codes, or all matching notes have dataFineValidita on or before today's date
Then return the statement "Status: Annotation check has passed. No blocking annotation found."</instructions>
