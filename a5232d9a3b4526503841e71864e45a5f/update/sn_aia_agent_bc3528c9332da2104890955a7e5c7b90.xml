- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the 'Get Account Closure request' tool to retrieve the account closure request details. Provide the record number as input.
  - Extract the following values from the request:
    - Client name
    - NDG
    - Account Number to Close
    - Account Number for Balance Transfer.
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the request details, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the 'Look up Client' tool to verify the client identity. Provide the `client_name` and `ndg` retrieved in Step 1 as inputs.
  - If the tool returns a success message indicating a single match, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool returns a failure message (e.g., no match or multiple matches), use the 'User Output' tool to display the error message to the user. Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 3: Look Up Client's Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Assets' tool to retrieve the client's assets. Provide the `ndg` retrieved in Step 1 as input.
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve client's assets. Please verify the NDG and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the retrieved client assets and evaluate the account eligibility based on the following rules:
    - **Rule R3**: Check if any active loan or policy exists. If an active loan or policy is found, use the 'User Output' tool to display: "Account closure is blocked due to an active loan or policy." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
    - **Rule R2**: Check if the account is of type 0040. If a matching account is found, proceed to the next step. If no match is found, use the 'User Output' tool to display: "No eligible account found for closure." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 5: Look Up Client Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Assets' tool again to retrieve the client's related assets. Provide the `ndg` and the principal account information (type and number) retrieved in Step 1 as inputs.
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the related assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve client's related assets. Please verify the account details and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 6: Analyze Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the related assets retrieved in Step 5. Determine if there are any dependencies or issues that might block the account closure process.
  - If any blocking issues are identified, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the specific issues. Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
  - If no blocking issues are found, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 7: Communicate Results to User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the final evaluation results. For example:
    - If the account is eligible for closure: "The account is eligible for closure. Please proceed with the next steps."
    - If the account is not eligible for closure: "The account cannot be closed due to the following reasons: [list reasons]."
  - Ensure the message is clear and concise, summarizing the findings from the previous steps.

- **Step 8: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once the results have been communicated to the user.

        <description>Responsible for checking whether a customer's bank account can be closed by evaluating active loans or insurance policies, annotations, and account restrictions. Returns findings with a summary of the closure timeline or explains why closure is not currently possible.</description>
        <external_agent_configuration/>
        <instructions>The steps below reference specific business rules, which are defined in the **Business Rules** section.

#### Step 1:  Look up request details
Retrieve the following values from the request record:
- Client name
- NDG
- Account Number to Close
- Account Number for Balance Transfer

#### Step 2: Verify Client Identity
1. Look up the client using the client name and NDG provided in the request. 
2. Execute Rule R1: Verify Client
   - If successful, proceed to the next step.  
   - If not, return the appropriate error and stop the workflow.

#### Step 3: Look up Client Assets
1. Look up the client's assets using the client's NDG provided in the request.

#### Step 4: Evaluate account eligibility
1. Evaluate the accordi elements in the client's assets
2. Execute the following rules in order:
- Rule R3: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
If this rule is triggered, return the blocking message and stop further evaluation.
- Rule R2: An account is eligible for closure if it is of type 0040
If the rule returns a success message, proceed to the next step, otherwise stop.

#### Step 5: Look up Client Related Assets
1. Look up the client's related assets using the client's principal account info (type and number)  in the request.


#### Business Rules

##### Rule R1: Verify Client
Search the datiAnagrafici array for entries where:
codiceTipoNDG.codice is "PF" (indicating a natural person), and
personaFisica.intestazione equals ”&lt;client's name&gt;".
If no match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: "Client not found for the provided NDG."
If exactly one match is found, return the message: “Verification successful: client &lt;name&gt; exists with NDG &lt;NDG&gt;."
If more than one match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for ”&lt;client's name&gt; with codiceTipoNDG 'PF’. Additional input required to disambiguate the client.”

##### Rule R2: An account is eligible for closure if it is of type 0040
If exactly one item in accordi has:
- tipoProdotto.codice = '0040'
- personaFisica.intestazione = &lt;client's name&gt;
Return "Success: Found a matching account with type = &lt;value of datiRapporto.tipo&gt;, number = &lt;value of datiRapporto.numero &gt;, holderName = &lt;value of personaFisica.intestazione&gt;"

If no match is found  
Return "Error: No account found for &lt;client's name&gt; and NDG &lt;NDG&gt;. Need further specification of the desired account."

if multiple matches are found, 
Return "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account."

### Rule R3: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
For each item in accordi, check if:
dataEstinzioneAccordo is later than today (i.e. the account is active)
AND formatoGenerico starts with:
"68" → indicates a policy
"11" → indicates a loan
If any such item exists, return this message:
"Attention: an active policy (format starts with '68') or loan (format starts with '11') is present for this NDG. The loan check is not OK."</instructions>
