- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the 'Get Account Closure request' tool to retrieve the following details from the request record:
    - Client name
    - NDG
    - Account Number to Close
    - Account Number for Balance Transfer
  - Input: Provide the record number of the account closure request.
  - Expected Outcome: The tool will return the required details. If the tool fails to retrieve the details, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the 'Look up Client' tool to verify the client using the retrieved client name.
    - Input: Provide the `client_name` retrieved in Step 1.
    - Expected Outcome: The tool will return client verification details.
      - If the client is successfully verified (exactly one match is found), proceed to the next step.
      - If no match is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
      - If multiple matches are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for the client. Additional input required to disambiguate the client." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 3: Look up Client's Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Assets' tool to retrieve the client's assets.
    - Input: Provide the `ndg` retrieved in Step 1.
    - Expected Outcome: The tool will return a list of the client's assets. If the tool fails to retrieve the assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve client's assets. Please verify the NDG and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility**
  - **Step 4.1: Check for Active Loans or Policies**
    - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the list of assets retrieved in Step 3 and apply Rule R3.
      - Input: Provide the list of assets and today's date to check for active loans or policies.
      - Expected Outcome:
        - If any active loans or policies are found (format starts with '68' for policies or '11' for loans), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Account closure is not allowed due to active loans or policies." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
        - If no active loans or policies are found, proceed to the next step.

  - **Step 4.2: Check Account Type Eligibility**
    - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the list of assets and apply Rule R2.
      - Input: Provide the list of assets and the account type '0040' to check for eligibility.
      - Expected Outcome:
        - If a matching account is found, proceed to the next step.
        - If no matching account is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "No eligible account found for closure. Please verify the account details." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
        - If multiple matching accounts are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Multiple eligible accounts found. Additional input required to specify the account for closure." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 5: Check for Blocking Annotations**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Annotations' tool to check for any active blocking annotations.
    - Input: Provide the `ndg` retrieved in Step 1.
    - Expected Outcome:
      - If any active blocking annotations are found (codes 004, 056, 057, or 484 with a validity date after today's date), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Account closure is not allowed due to active blocking annotations." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
      - If no active blocking annotations are found, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 6: Generate Closure Decision**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize the results of all previous steps and generate the final closure decision.
    - Input: Provide the results of Steps 1–5, including the request number, client name, NDG, account number, and any relevant findings.
    - Expected Outcome: The tool will generate a JSON object with the following fields:
      - `request_number`: The unique request number for this account closure.
      - `can_be_closed`: true or false, based on the evaluation outcome.
      - `status_reason`: A short, high-level explanation of the decision.
      - `external_summary`: A customer-friendly explanation for follow-up emails.
      - `internal_summary`: A technical explanation including relevant data values and business rule references.
      - `client_name`: The full name of the client.
      - `ndg`: The client’s NDG number.
      - `account_number`: The account number targeted for closure.
      - `client_email`: The client’s email address.

- **Step 7: Inform the User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the external summary of the closure decision to the user.
    - Input: Provide the `external_summary` field from the JSON object generated in Step 6.

- **Step 8: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

        <description>Responsible for checking whether a customer's bank account can be closed by evaluating active loans or insurance policies, annotations, and account restrictions. Returns findings with a summary of the closure timeline or explains why closure is not currently possible.</description>
        <external_agent_configuration/>
        <instructions>Follow the steps below to determine if the account can be closed. Note that the steps reference specific business rules, which are defined in the **Business Rules** section.

#### Step 1:  Look up request details
Retrieve the following values from the request record:
- Client name
- NDG
- Account Number to Close
- Account Number for Balance Transfer

#### Step 2: Verify Client Identity
1. Look up the client using the client name and NDG provided in the request. 
2. Execute Rule R1: Verify Client
   - If successful, proceed to the next step.  
   - If not, return the appropriate error and stop the workflow.

#### Step 3: Look up Client Assets
1. Look up the client's assets using the client's NDG provided in the request.

#### Step 4: Evaluate account eligibility

1. Apply Rule R3 to the full list of `accordi` to determine if any active loans or policies are present.
   - If Rule R3 returns a blocking condition, return the message and stop evaluation.

2. If no blocking condition was found in Rule R3, apply Rule R2 to determine if the account is eligible for closure.
   - If Rule R2 returns a success message, proceed to the next step.
   - If not, return the error and stop evaluation.


After completing all the previous steps, return the result as a JSON object. 
The object must include the following fields:
- request_number: The unique request number for this account closure.
- can_be_closed: true or false, based on the evaluation outcome.
- status_reason: A short, high-level explanation of the decision (e.g., "Active policy exists" or "Closure approved").
- external_summary: A customer-friendly explanation that can be shared in follow-up emails.
- internal_summary: A technical explanation including relevant data values and business rule references.
- client_name: The full name of the client.
- ndg: The client’s NDG number.
- account_number: The account number targeted for closure.
- client_email: The client’s email address (retrieved from the client record, not from the request itself).


#### Business Rules

##### Rule R1: Verify Client
Search the datiAnagrafici array for entries where:
codiceTipoNDG.codice is "PF" (indicating a natural person), 
and personaFisica.intestazione equals ”{client's name}".

If no match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: "Client not found for the provided NDG."

If exactly one match is found, return the message: “Verification successful: client {name} exists with NDG {NDG}."

If more than one match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for ”{client's name} with codiceTipoNDG 'PF’. Additional input required to disambiguate the client.”

##### Rule R2: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure
If exactly one item in accordi has:
- tipoProdotto.codice = '0040'
- personaFisica.intestazione = {client's name}
Then 
1. Extract the following values:
- datiRapporto.tipo → store as TipoSecNew
- datiRapporto.numero → store as NumSecNew
2. Split the formatoGenerico string into four parts: servizio, filiale, categoria, partita
3. Return "Success: Found a matching account with:
• Account Type: {value of datiRapporto.tipo}
• Account Number: {value of datiRapporto.numero}
• Holder Name: {value of personaFisica.intestazione}
• Product Mapping Identifier: {servizio} / {filiale} / {categoria} / {partita}"

If no match is found  
Return "Error: No account found for {client's name} and NDG {NDG}. Need further specification of the desired account."

if multiple matches are found, 
Return "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account."

For each item in the `accordi` list:
- If `dataEstinzioneAccordo` is later than today's date (i.e. the product is still active),  
**AND**
- if the first two digits of formatoGenerico are:
  - 68 → indicates a policy
  - 11 → indicates a loan
Then return the following message and stop evaluation:
Attention: An active policy (format starts with '68') or loan (format starts with '11') is present for the NDG {ndg}. The loan check is not OK. Account closure is not allowed. Reason: Rule R3: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists



##### Rule R4: List unique account relationships per product
In `listaCollegamentoAccordo`, collect for every item:
- `prodotto.codiceprodotto.codice` → **Product Code**
- `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` → **Product Description**
- `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.tipo` → **Type (secnew)**
- `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.numero` → **Number (secnew)**
and only keep the unique records (same four fields).

If matches are found, 
Return the statement: "Found {N} unique account relationship(s):" followed by a numbered list, where each line contains: product code {…}, described as ‘{…}’, type {…}, number {…}.

If no matches are found, 
Return the statement: "No linked accounts found."


##### Rule R5.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
If any annotation in the lista array has a codiceNota.codice equal to one of the following values: 004, 056, 057, or 484, and its dataFineValidita is after today's date, 
Then return the statement: "Annotation check has not passed. Found {N} annotation(s):" followed by a numbered list, where each entry contains: 
   "Blocking Reason:" {tipologiaNota.descrizione}, Effective Period: {dataInizioValidita} – {dataFineValidita}

##### Rule R5.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found
If none of the annotations in lista match the specified codes, or all matching notes have dataFineValidita on or before today's date
Then return the statement "Status: Annotation check has passed. No blocking annotation found."</instructions>
