- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the 'Get Account Closure request' tool to retrieve the following details from the request record:
    - Client name
    - NDG
    - Account Number to Close
    - Account Number for Balance Transfer
  - Input: Provide the record number of the account closure request.
  - Expected Outcome: The tool will return the required details. If the tool fails to retrieve the details, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the 'Look up Client' tool to verify the client using the client name retrieved in Step 1.
  - Input: Provide the `client_name` as input.
  - Expected Outcome:
    - If the tool returns a single match, proceed to the next step.
    - If no match is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
    - If multiple matches are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for the client name. Additional input required to disambiguate the client." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 3: Look Up Client's Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Assets' tool to retrieve the client's assets using the NDG retrieved in Step 1.
  - Input: Provide the `ndg` as input.
  - Expected Outcome:
    - If the tool successfully retrieves the client's assets, proceed to the next step.
    - If the tool fails to retrieve the assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve client's assets. Please verify the NDG and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the client's assets and evaluate account eligibility based on the following rules:
    - **Rule R3**: Check if any active loan or policy exists. If any item in the assets has `dataEstinzioneAccordo` later than today and `formatoGenerico` starts with "68" (policy) or "11" (loan), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Attention: An active policy or loan is present for this NDG. The loan check is not OK." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
    - **Rule R2**: Check if the account is of type 0040. If exactly one matching account is found, proceed to the next step. If no match is found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Error: No account found for the client and NDG. Need further specification of the desired account." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude. If multiple matches are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 5: Look Up Client's Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up client's related assets' tool to retrieve the client's related assets using the principal account information (type and number) retrieved in Step 1.
  - Input: Provide the `account_number` and `account_type` as inputs.
  - Expected Outcome:
    - If the tool successfully retrieves the related assets, proceed to the next step.
    - If the tool fails to retrieve the related assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve client's related assets. Please verify the account information and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 6: Analyze Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize the information from the related assets and determine if there are any additional dependencies or blockers for account closure.
  - Input: Provide a detailed analysis of the related assets retrieved in Step 5.
  - Expected Outcome:
    - If no blockers are identified, proceed to the next step.
    - If blockers are identified, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the specific blockers and conclude using the 'Finish' tool.

- **Step 7: Communicate Results to User**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the final eligibility status of the account closure request. Include any relevant details or blockers identified during the evaluation process.

- **Step 8: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution once the mission is successfully achieved or if the process cannot proceed further due to blockers or missing information.

        <description>Responsible for checking whether a customer's bank account can be closed by evaluating active loans or insurance policies, annotations, and account restrictions. Returns findings with a summary of the closure timeline or explains why closure is not currently possible.</description>
        <external_agent_configuration/>
        <instructions>The steps below reference specific business rules, which are defined in the **Business Rules** section.

#### Step 1:  Look up request details
Retrieve the following values from the request record:
- Client name
- NDG
- Account Number to Close
- Account Number for Balance Transfer

#### Step 2: Verify Client Identity
1. Look up the client using the client name provided in the request. 
2. Execute Rule R1: Verify Client
   - If successful, proceed to the next step.  
   - If not, return the appropriate error and stop the workflow.

#### Step 3: Look up Client Assets
1. Look up the client's assets using the client's NDG provided in the request.

#### Step 4: Evaluate account eligibility
1. Evaluate the accordi elements in the client's assets
2. Execute the following rules in order:
- Rule R3: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
If this rule is triggered, return the blocking message and stop further evaluation.
- Rule R2: An account is eligible for closure if it is of type 0040
If the rule returns a success message, proceed to the next step, otherwise stop.

#### Step 5: Look up Client Related Assets
1. Look up the client's related assets using the client's principal account info (type and number)  in the request.


#### Business Rules

##### Rule R1: Verify Client
Search the datiAnagrafici array for entries where:
codiceTipoNDG.codice is "PF" (indicating a natural person), and
personaFisica.intestazione equals ”&lt;client's name&gt;".
If no match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: "Client not found for the provided NDG."
If exactly one match is found, return the message: “Verification successful: client &lt;name&gt; exists with NDG &lt;NDG&gt;."
If more than one match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for ”&lt;client's name&gt; with codiceTipoNDG 'PF’. Additional input required to disambiguate the client.”

##### Rule R2: An account is eligible for closure if it is of type 0040
If exactly one item in accordi has:
- tipoProdotto.codice = '0040'
- personaFisica.intestazione = &lt;client's name&gt;
Return "Success: Found a matching account with type = &lt;value of datiRapporto.tipo&gt;, number = &lt;value of datiRapporto.numero &gt;, holderName = &lt;value of personaFisica.intestazione&gt;"

If no match is found  
Return "Error: No account found for &lt;client's name&gt; and NDG &lt;NDG&gt;. Need further specification of the desired account."

if multiple matches are found, 
Return "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account."

##### Rule R3: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
For each item in accordi, check if:
dataEstinzioneAccordo is later than today (i.e. the account is active)
AND formatoGenerico starts with:
"68" → indicates a policy
"11" → indicates a loan
If any such item exists, return this message:
"Attention: an active policy (format starts with '68') or loan (format starts with '11') is present for this NDG. The loan check is not OK."</instructions>
