- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the 'Get Account Closure request' tool to retrieve the account closure request details. Provide the record number as input to this tool.
  - Ensure the output includes the following details:
    - Client name
    - NDG
    - Account Number to Close
    - Account Number for Balance Transfer
  - If the tool fails or does not return the required details, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "I could not retrieve the account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the 'Look up Client' tool to verify the client identity. Provide the 'client_name' retrieved in Step 1 as input to this tool.
  - If the tool successfully retrieves the client details, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails or does not return the client details, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "I could not verify the client identity. Please check the client name and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 3: Look Up Client's Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Assets' tool to retrieve the client's assets. Provide the 'NDG' retrieved in Step 1 as input to this tool.
  - If the tool successfully retrieves the client's assets, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails or does not return the client's assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "I could not retrieve the client's related assets. Please verify the NDG and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 4: Analyze Client's Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the client's related assets retrieved in Step 3. Provide a detailed analysis input, such as: "Analyze the client's related assets to determine if any linked financial products or obligations might block the account closure process."
  - If the analysis indicates that the account closure is blocked due to linked financial products or obligations, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "The account closure process is blocked due to linked financial products or obligations. Please resolve these issues before proceeding." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
  - If the analysis indicates no blocking issues, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 5: Look Up Client's Related Assets by Account**
  - Use the 'Look up client's related assets' tool to further investigate the client's related assets based on the account to be closed. Provide the following inputs:
    - 'account_number': The Account Number to Close retrieved in Step 1.
    - 'account_type': Specify the account type based on the retrieved details (e.g., savings, checking, etc.).
  - If the tool successfully retrieves the related assets, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails or does not return the related assets, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "I could not retrieve the related assets for the account. Please verify the account details and try again." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 6: Analyze Account-Specific Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the account-specific related assets retrieved in Step 5. Provide a detailed analysis input, such as: "Analyze the related assets for the account to be closed to ensure there are no dependencies or obligations that might block the closure process."
  - If the analysis indicates that the account closure is blocked due to dependencies or obligations, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "The account closure process is blocked due to dependencies or obligations related to the account. Please resolve these issues before proceeding." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.
  - If the analysis indicates no blocking issues, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 7: Confirm Account Closure Eligibility**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize all the information gathered so far (client details, related assets, and account-specific related assets) to confirm the account closure eligibility. Provide a detailed input, such as: "Based on the retrieved client details, related assets, and account-specific related assets, confirm whether the account is eligible for closure."
  - If the analysis confirms eligibility, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "The account is eligible for closure. You may proceed with the closure process."
  - If the analysis indicates ineligibility, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "The account is not eligible for closure due to unresolved issues. Please address these issues before proceeding." Then, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude.

- **Step 8: Completion**
  - Once the account closure eligibility has been determined and communicated to the user, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.
