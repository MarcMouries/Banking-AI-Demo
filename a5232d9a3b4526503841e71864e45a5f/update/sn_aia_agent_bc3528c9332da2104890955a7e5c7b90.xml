- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the 'Get Account Closure request' tool to retrieve the account closure request details.
    - Input: Provide the record number of the request.
    - Expected Output: The tool will return the following details:
      - Client name
      - NDG
      - Account Number to Close
      - Account Number for Balance Transfer
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the details, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again."
  - Do not proceed until the account closure request details are successfully retrieved.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the 'Look up Client' tool to search for the client by their name.
    - Input: Provide the client name retrieved in Step 1.
    - Expected Output: The tool will return client details or indicate if no match is found.
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the output and determine if the client exists and matches the provided NDG.
    - If no match is found, use the 'User Output' tool to display: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG."
    - If multiple matches are found, use the 'User Output' tool to display: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for the client name. Additional input required to disambiguate the client."
    - If exactly one match is found, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 3: Look Up Client's Annotations**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Annotations' tool to check for any active annotations on the client's NDG.
    - Input: Provide the NDG retrieved in Step 1.
    - Expected Output: The tool will return any active annotations associated with the client.
  - If active annotations are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Account closure may be blocked due to active annotations. Please review the annotations for further details."
  - If no active annotations are found, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 4: Look Up Client's Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up Client's Assets' tool to retrieve all assets linked to the client's NDG.
    - Input: Provide the NDG retrieved in Step 1.
    - Expected Output: The tool will return a list of all assets associated with the client.
  - If no assets are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "No assets found for the client. Proceeding with account closure evaluation."
  - If assets are found, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the assets and determine if any of them might block the account closure process.

- **Step 5: Look Up Client's Related Assets**
  - Use the 'Look up client's related assets' tool to check for any related assets tied to the account number to close.
    - Input: Provide the account number to close and the account type (if available).
    - Expected Output: The tool will return details of related assets.
  - If related assets are found, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Account closure may be blocked due to related assets. Please review the related assets for further details."
  - If no related assets are found, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 6: Analyze Account Closure Eligibility**
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to synthesize all retrieved information (client details, annotations, assets, and related assets) and determine if the account is eligible for closure.
    - Input: Provide a detailed analysis of all retrieved data to evaluate closure eligibility.
    - Expected Output: A synthesized conclusion on whether the account can be closed or if there are blocking factors.
  - If the analysis indicates that the account cannot be closed, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "Account closure is not possible due to identified blocking factors. Please review the details and address the issues before proceeding."
  - If the analysis indicates that the account can be closed, proceed to the next step.

- **Step 7: Inform User of Closure Eligibility**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the final eligibility status for account closure.
    - If eligible: "The account is eligible for closure. Please proceed with the necessary steps."
    - If not eligible: "The account is not eligible for closure. Please address the identified issues before proceeding."

- **Step 8: Completion**
  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

   - If successful, proceed to the next step.  
   - If not, return the appropriate error and stop the workflow.


#### Business Rules

##### Rule R1: Verify Client
Search the datiAnagrafici array for entries where:
codiceTipoNDG.codice is "PF" (indicating a natural person), 
and personaFisica.intestazione equals ”{client's name}".

If no match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: "Client not found for the provided NDG."

If exactly one match is found, return the message: “Verification successful: client {name} exists with NDG {NDG}."

If more than one match is found, return the message: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for ”{client's name} with codiceTipoNDG 'PF’. Additional input required to disambiguate the client.”</instructions>
