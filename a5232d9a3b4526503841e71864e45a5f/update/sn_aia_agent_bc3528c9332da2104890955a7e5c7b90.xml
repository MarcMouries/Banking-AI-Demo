- **Step 1: Retrieve Account Closure Request Details**
  - Use the `Get Account Closure request` tool to retrieve the account closure request details. Provide the `number` input as the record number of the request.
  - If the tool successfully retrieves the details, proceed to the next step.
  - If the tool fails to retrieve the details, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Unable to retrieve account closure request details. Please verify the record number and try again." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 2: Verify Client Identity**
  - Use the `Look up Client` tool to search for the client using the `client_name` retrieved in Step 1.
  - Once the client is found, apply **Rule R2: Verify Client**:
    - If one match is found, proceed to the next step.
    - If no match is found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
    - If multiple matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for the client. Additional input required." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 3: Look Up Client's Assets**
  - Use the `Look up Client's Assets` tool with the `NDG` retrieved in Step 1 to fetch the client's assets.
  - For each item in the `accordi` array from the response:
    - Extract `formatoGenerico` as `number`.
    - Extract `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` as `description`.
    - Apply **Rule R1: Account Classification** to classify the asset type based on the first two digits of `number`.
  - Store the resulting list of client assets in `${client_assets}` as a valid JSON object with the structure:
    ```json
    { "products": [ { "number": "{number}", "description": "{description}", "type": "{type}" }, ... ] }
    ```
  - Use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "The customer owns the following assets:
    - {type} {description} ({number})
    - ..."
  - Use the `Add Client's Asset to the Request` tool to add the client's assets to the request. Provide the `request_number` and `client_assets` as inputs.

- **Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility**
  - Apply **Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists**:
    - If any asset in `${client_assets}` has `dataEstinzioneAccordo` later than today and `type` is `"Loan"` or `"Policy"`, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "An active {type} ({number}) is present for NDG {NDG}. Account closure is not allowed." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
  - If no blocking condition is found, apply **Rule R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure**:
    - Use the original `accordi` response to check if the account is of type 0040.
    - If a matching account is found, proceed to the next step.
    - If no match is found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Error: No account found for the client and NDG. Need further specification of the desired account." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
    - If multiple matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account." Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 5: Look Up Client's Related Assets**
  - Use the `Look up client's related assets` tool with the `account_number` and `account_type` of the identified account to fetch related assets.
  - Apply **Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product**:
    - If matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Found {N} unique account relationship(s):" followed by a numbered list of the relationships.
    - If no matches are found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "No linked accounts found."

- **Step 6: Check for Blocking Annotations**
  - Use the `Look up Client's Annotations` tool with the `NDG` to fetch active annotations.
  - Evaluate each element in the `lista` field of the response:
    - Apply **Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists**:
      - If any annotation has a `codiceNota.codice` of 004, 056, 057, or 484 and `dataFineValidita` is after today's date, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Annotation check has not passed. Found {N} annotation(s):" followed by a numbered list of the blocking reasons. Then, use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.
    - Apply **Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found**:
      - If no blocking annotations are found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "Status: Annotation check has passed. No blocking annotation found."

- **Step 7: Completion**
  - If all steps are successfully completed and no blocking conditions are found, use the `User Output` tool to inform the user: "The account is eligible for closure. All checks have passed."
  - Use the `Finish` tool to conclude the execution.

        <description>Evaluate whether a customer's bank account can be closed by evaluating active loans, insurance policies, annotations, and account restrictions. 

As part of this process, the agent presents a summary of the customer's assets to the end user for visibility before continuing with the execution of eligibility evaluation business rules. 

Returns findings with a summary of the closure timeline or explains why closure is not currently possible.</description>
        <external_agent_configuration/>
        <instructions>The steps below reference specific business rules, which are defined in the **Business Rules** section.
You must keep track of every business rule that you evaluate or use, even if it does not block or enable account closure. This includes rules used for classification, verification, eligibility checks, or annotations.
At the end of the evaluation, include a list of all these rules as "sources" in the structured output.

- Rule R1: Account Classification
- Rule R2: Verify Client
- Rule R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure
- Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
- Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product
- Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
- Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found

#### Step 1:  Look up request details
Retrieve the following values from the request record:
- Client name
- NDG
- Account Number to Close
- Account Number for Balance Transfer

#### Step 2: Verify Client Identity

1. Look up the client using the client name and NDG provided in the request. 
2. Execute Rule R2: Verify Client
   - If successful, proceed to the next step.  
   - If not, return the appropriate error and stop the workflow.

#### Step 3: Look up Client Assets
1. Look up the client's assets using the client's NDG provided in the request.

2. For each item in the `accordi` array from the response:
    - Extract `formatoGenerico` as `number`
    - Extract `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` as `description`
    - Apply Rule R1: Account Classification to derive the `type` based on `number`


3. Store the resulting list of client assets in ${client_assets}` as a JSON object with the following structure. Do not include any extra formatting or line breaks. This must be valid JSON, not markdown or formatted output. The structure is the following:


3. Store the resulting list of client assets in `${client_assets}` as a valid JSON object with the following structure.  Do not include any extra formatting, markdown, or line breaks. This must be a valid machine-readable JSON.  The structure is:
{ "products": [ { "number": "{number}", "description": "{description}", "type": "{type}"},
...]}


4. Communicate the following message to the user using the values from ${client_assets}: "The customer owns the following assets:
- {type} {description} ({number})
- ..."

5. Add the client's assets to the request using:
- `client_assets`: the array created in Step 3
- `request_number`: the current request number

#### Step 4: Evaluate Account Eligibility
1. Apply Rule "R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists" to the `${client_assets}` list.
   - If a blocking condition is found, return the message and stop.
2. If no blocking condition was found, apply Rule "R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure" directly on the original `accordi` response to verify if the account is of type 0040 and can be closed.
   - If successful, proceed.
   - Otherwise, return the error and stop.


#### Step 5: Look up Client Related Assets

1. Look up the client’s related assets using the account number and account type from the identified account relationship.
2. Apply the following rules in order:
- Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product

#### Step 6: Check for Blocking Annotations
1. Look up any active annotations using the client's NDG. 
2. Evaluate each element in the lista field of the response to identify relevant annotations
3. Apply the following rules in order:
   1. Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
   2. Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found


#### Business Rules

##### Rule R1: Account Classification
Given an input value `number` (i.e., the `formatoGenerico` field from the asset record), classify the asset type using the first two digits:

- If `number` starts with `06` → return `type = "Current Account"`
- If `number` starts with `68` → return `type = "Policy"`
- If `number` starts with `11` → return `type = "Loan"`
- Otherwise return `type = "Unknown"`


##### Rule R2: Verify Client
Search the `datiAnagrafici` array for entries where:
- `codiceTipoNDG.codice` is `"PF"` (natural person)
- `personaFisica.intestazione` equals the provided client name
Return:
- ✅ If one match: "Verification successful: client {name} exists with NDG {NDG}."
- ❌ If no match: "Verification failed: Client not found for the provided NDG."
- ❌ If multiple matches: "Verification failed: Multiple NDG entries found for {name} with codiceTipoNDG 'PF'. Additional input required."

##### Rule R3: An account must be of type 0040 to be considered for closure
If exactly one item in the `accordi` array has:
- `tipoProdotto.codice = '0040'`
- `personaFisica.intestazione` = {client name}
Then 
1. Extract the following values:
- datiRapporto.tipo → store as TipoSecNew
- datiRapporto.numero → store as NumSecNew
2. Split the formatoGenerico string into four parts: servizio, filiale, categoria, partita
3. Return "Success: Found a matching account with:
• Account Type: {value of datiRapporto.tipo}
• Account Number: {value of datiRapporto.numero}
• Holder Name: {value of personaFisica.intestazione}
• Product Mapping Identifier: {servizio} / {filiale} / {categoria} / {partita}"

If no match is found  
Return "Error: No account found for {client's name} and NDG {NDG}. Need further specification of the desired account."

if multiple matches are found, 
Return "Error: Multiple accounts found. Need further specification of the desired account."

##### Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists
If any asset the list of client assets stored in `${client_assets}` meets both of the following conditions:
- `dataEstinzioneAccordo` is later than today (i.e., the product is still active)
- `type` is `"loan"` or `"policy"`
Then return the following message and stop evaluation: An active {type} ({number}) is present for NDG {ndg}. Account closure is not allowed. &gt; Reason: Rule R4: Account closure is not allowed if an active loan or policy exists.

##### Rule R5: List unique account relationships per product
In `listaCollegamentoAccordo`, collect for every item:
- `prodotto.codiceprodotto.codice` → **Product Code**
- `prodotto.descrizioneProdotto` → **Product Description**
- `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.tipo` → **Type (secnew)**
- `datiCollegati.datirapportosecnew.numero` → **Number (secnew)**
and only keep the unique records (same four fields).

If matches are found, 
Return the statement: "Found {N} unique account relationship(s):" followed by a numbered list, where each line contains: product code {…}, described as ‘{…}’, type {…}, number {…}.

If no matches are found, 
Return the statement: "No linked accounts found."


##### Rule R6.1: Block account closure if an active blocking annotation exists
If any annotation in the lista array has a codiceNota.codice equal to one of the following values: 004, 056, 057, or 484, and its dataFineValidita is after today's date, 
Then return the statement: "Annotation check has not passed. Found {N} annotation(s):" followed by a numbered list, where each entry contains: 
   "Blocking Reason:" {tipologiaNota.descrizione}, Effective Period: {dataInizioValidita} – {dataFineValidita}

##### Rule R6.2: Annotation check passes if no active relevant notes are found
If none of the annotations in lista match the specified codes, or all matching notes have dataFineValidita on or before today's date
Then return the statement "Status: Annotation check has passed. No blocking annotation found."</instructions>
