    - `email_subject`: "Your Account Closure Request Has Been Approved".

  - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

  - If the user does not approve sending the email:
    - Use the 'User Output' tool to display: "The email was not sent. Please provide further instructions if needed.".
    - Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.

- **Step 6: Unexpected Scenarios**
